# Scripts

This repository contains some scripts I wrote to streamline or automate so tasks that I perform often

- ts: This script provides a fzf interface to select sessions in tmux. I use in conjunction with tmux plugin tmux-ressurect, tmux-continuum to automatically restore session on boot

- setup_script.py: This is a work in progress. It it intended to install and setup window manager, keybinds and application on a fresh linux install as I like it.
